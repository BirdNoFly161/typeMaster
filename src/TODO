-make shift keydown a variable shared between child components using react context, so u can render the components diffrent depending on wether shift is press or not. [DONE]

- account for left and right shift for the keydown even that triggers the alt characaters [DONE]

-unpress all keys when alt tabbed, (reset to init state)


- fix return condition

- fix redundant onkeyDown

- fix svg top bottom placement [DONE]

- fix handling of characters that appear twice in the keyboard ("\" and "|")

- move setLastKeypressIsCorrect and setGeneratedChar to improve the interactivity right now it seems too abrubt the way a keystroke is judged immediately

- add azerty support

- handle caps lock (i almost never want it to be active it would be great to disable its effect completly else just notify the user to turn it off)
